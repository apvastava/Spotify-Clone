# Spotify Web Player Clone

This project is a simplified clone of the Spotify web player. It includes a sidebar with navigation options, a main content area displaying recently played and trending music, and a fixed music player at the bottom of the screen.

## Project Structure

### HTML

The HTML structure consists of:

- A `<head>` section with metadata and links to stylesheets and fonts.
- A `<body>` section with the main content divided into three parts:
  - `sidebar`: Contains navigation options and a library section.
  - `main-content`: Displays the recently played and trending music, along with Spotify playlists.
  - `music-player`: A fixed bottom music player with album details and playback controls.

### CSS

The CSS file provides the styling for the following elements:

- Global styles: Font, margin, padding, and box-sizing settings.
- `body`: Background color and text color.
- `main`: Flexbox layout for the main container.
- `sidebar`: Styles for the sidebar, including background color, width, and padding.
- `main-content`: Styles for the main content area, including background color, padding, and margins.
